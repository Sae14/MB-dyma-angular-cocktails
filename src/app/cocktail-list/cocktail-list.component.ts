The mixture of white rum, mint, lime juice, sugar and soda water is crisp and clean with a relatively low alcohol content, the soda water can be replaced with sprite or 7-up. When preparing a mojito always crush the mint leaves as opposed to dicing to unlock oils that will assist with enhancing the minty flavour.'

      description: 'The tangy concoction of vodka, triple sec, lime juice and cranberry juice has managed to leapfrog the venerable screwdriver as many vodka drinkers prefer the Cosmopolitanâ€™s cleaner and slightly tart taste. The keys to the preparation of a Cosmopolitan are a good brand of cranberry juice and Cointreau Triple Sec, two essential elements to the drink.'
